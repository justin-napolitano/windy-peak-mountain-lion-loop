### Gear Review

I overdressed... Again.   I was overheating early in the hike so I removed my base layer. I felt more comfortable in a sun hoody. 

I did not remove the base layers on my legs.. I was still kinda overheating.. I ned to find a solution for summer baselayers

### Cotton Pants

I will not wear cotton pants again. I sweat through the seat. I think a wool poly pant will be perfect.  I need to find a good set from the surplus store.
