# Windy Peak via Mountain Lion Loop: Project Reference

## Motivation

This project serves as a personal documentation and planning tool for a day hike on Windy Peak accessed via the Mountain Lion Loop trail in Colorado. The motivation is to consolidate hike details, gear planning, and personal observations in one place to facilitate preparation and reflection for future trips.

## Problem Addressed

Outdoor hikes require careful planning regarding route, gear, nutrition, and timing. This documentation addresses the lack of a centralized, personal reference for this specific trail, which is rated as hard on All Trails but subjectively manageable. It captures practical insights that are not typically available in generic trail descriptions.

## How It's Built

The project is a single Markdown file (`index.md`) formatted with front matter metadata suitable for static site generators. It includes structured sections covering hike details, driving directions, gear lists, food planning, and a post-hike gear review.

Links to external resources such as All Trails, Google Maps, and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife site are embedded for quick reference.

## Implementation Details

- **Metadata**: The front matter includes title, description, author, tags, categories, and date, enabling easy integration with static site tools.

- **Content Structure**: The content is divided into logical sections: Details, Plan (with subcategories for driving, food, gear, car), The Hike (outline and gear review).

- **Gear Lists**: Detailed lists for backpack contents, sling bag items, clothing, shoes, and accessories reflect practical considerations and adjustments based on experience.

- **Post-Hike Review**: Honest evaluation of gear choices and comfort levels, highlighting areas for improvement such as clothing material suitability for summer heat.

- **Links**: External URLs provide context and additional information, reducing duplication and keeping the document concise.

## Practical Notes

- The project does not include software or code beyond Markdown documentation, emphasizing its role as a reference rather than an application.

- The structure supports incremental updates and expansions, such as adding photos or GPS data.

- The tone is pragmatic and focused on utility, avoiding motivational or lifestyle language.

- This documentation can be adapted for other hikes or outdoor activities with minimal changes.

## Summary

This repository exemplifies a practical approach to documenting outdoor activities with a focus on utility and personal reflection. It provides a clear, structured reference that supports preparation, execution, and post-activity evaluation for the Windy Peak via Mountain Lion Loop hike.
